# Kids-Learning-Hub

The Kid's Learning Hub is an application made for young people to learn the basic lessons in an interactive way. Like interactive flash cards. It includes awesome graphics and audio that will capture the interest of the audiences. This app is a school project for "System Analysis and Design".

My team and I made this with the inspiration of helping young children learn in a more awesome way. Originally the app is deployed for mobile devices so they can enjoy it even if they aren't at school. The original title of this app is Columban College Kids Learning Hub (CCKLH).

This app is also recognized by Department of Education and is deployed to schools around Olongapo City. The systems have 2 way access one for teachers to monitor the scores and account management the other is for the student, using the device's camera the students may log-in to his or her account by scanning the barcode in their IDs.
Developed using HTML, CSS, JS, Cordova/Phonegap and Electron JS.
